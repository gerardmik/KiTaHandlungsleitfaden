        <p>If many educators are sick, not all children can go to kindergarten. Then some children must stay at home.</p>
            <p>The kindergarten tells the parent representatives when many educators are sick. The parent representatives write in the WhatsApp group how many children can come.</p>
            <p>If parents must take their child to kindergarten because they may have to work, write this in the WhatsApp group. Then the other parents will know whether there are still enough places for their child.</p>
            <p>No one is forced to write in the WhatsApp group whether they send their child. But it would be very good if you write in the WhatsApp group if you must bring your child. Because then the other parents will know whether there are still places available.</p>
            <p>If the kindergarten cannot look after all the children because many educators are sick, the parents must help each other. That's why we thought about it.</p>
            <p></p>If all parents participate, it helps all parents. And there is no chaos in the kindergarten.
